    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Beef stew with whole tomatoes is a traditional, hearty dish full of flavor, characterized by slow-cooked beef in a rich tomato sauce. 
       The beef, typically cut into cubes or smaller pieces, is first browned to release its juices, and then whole tomatoes, either fresh or canned, 
       are added to create a sweet-and-sour taste and a soft texture. In some variations, vegetables like onions, carrots, or peppers are included,
       and seasonings such as garlic, bay leaves, black pepper, and thyme complete the dish, giving it a rich, aromatic flavor. 
       The stew is simmered on low heat, allowing the beef to become tender and absorb all the flavors of the sauce. 
       It is often served with polenta or fresh bread, making it a comforting and filling meal.</p>
    
   <h2>Ingredients(6-8 servings)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>beef (pulp) - 1.5 kg</li>
        <li>sunflower oil - 3 tablespoons</li>
        <li>2 medium onions</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>500 g whole peeled canned tomatoes
            about 150-200 ml water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground sweet paprika
            salt to taste</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>ground pepper about 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>7-8 black peppercorns(optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the beef into suitable pieces (not very small, but not huge either).</li>
        <li>Put the oil in a saucepan and place it over medium heat. Add the beef pieces and cook until they change color (about 6-7 minutes).</li>
        <li>After the meat has changed color, add the finely chopped onion and garlic, salt to taste, ground pepper, peppercorns, and sweet paprika.</li>
        <li>Mix well, add about 150 ml of water and cover the pan with a lid. The meat should be completely covered with water during boiling.
            Simmer the beef stew, over low heat, for about 1 hour or until the meat is three-quarters cooked.</li>
        <li>Once the meat is almost cooked, add the canned tomatoes, whole, plus the canned sauce. Mix carefully and cover the pan with the lid again.</li>
        <li>Simmer the stew for another 30 minutes or until the sauce becomes creamy and the meat is perfectly cooked.</li>
        <li>We enjoy this beef and tomato sauce dish with polenta or mashed potatoes and, if desired, pickles. 
            It is very simple to make and is a perfect stew for the whole family, on these cool autumn days. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
