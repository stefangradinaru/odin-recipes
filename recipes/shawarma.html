    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A shawarma is a delicious Middle Eastern dish made of thinly sliced marinated meat, typically lamb, chicken, or beef, which is slowly 
       roasted on a vertical rotisserie. The meat is crispy on the outside yet tender and juicy on the inside. Served in a warm flatbread or
       pita, it is often accompanied by a variety of fresh toppings such as tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and pickles, along with creamy sauces 
       like garlic mayo or tahini. The combination of savory, tangy, and sometimes spicy flavors makes shawarma a satisfying and flavorful meal
       that has gained popularity worldwide.</p>
    <p>This shawarma is the best choice for a tasty and quick lunch.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Meat: Choose your meat (chicken, lamb, beef, or a mix) and cut it into thin slices. Marinate the meat for several hours or overnight
            in a mixture of yogurt, olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, cumin, paprika, coriander, and other spices to add flavor.</li>
        <li>Cook the Meat: If you have a vertical rotisserie, thread the marinated meat onto the spit and roast it slowly. Alternatively, you can cook
            the meat in a hot skillet or grill pan until it's crispy on the outside and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Sauce: Make the classic garlic sauce by mixing mayonnaise, yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt. Alternatively, 
            you can make tahini sauce by blending tahini paste with lemon juice, olive oil, and water.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Vegetables: Slice fresh vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and pickles. You can also add some lettuce or cabbage for extra
            crunch.</li>
        <li>Warm the Flatbread or Pita: Heat your flatbread or pita in a pan for a few seconds to make it soft and warm.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Shawarma: Place the warm flatbread on a plate. Layer the cooked meat, followed by the vegetables, and drizzle the garlic or 
            tahini sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Roll and Serve: Roll the flatbread around the fillings, folding the ends in to create a wrap. Cut in half and serve with extra sauce or sides like
            fries or salad.</li>
    </ol>
