    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Potatoes and zucchini in the pan are a simple and delicious dish, where potatoes, cut into slices or cubes, and zucchinis, 
       sliced into rounds or halves, are fried together in oil until golden and crispy. They are usually seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic,
       and herbs to enhance the flavor. They can be served as a side dish or as a main course, making for a quick and healthy option.</p>
    
   <h2>Ingredients(2-4 people)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium red potatoes (about 400 g unpeeled)</li>
        <li>2 medium zucchini (about 200 g unpeeled)</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>50 ml peanut/sunflower oil</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>We clean the potatoes, wash them and cut them into suitable cubes.</li>
        <li>Wash the zucchini, do not peel them, and cut them into cubes the size of potato cubes.</li>
        <li>Put the oil in a non-stick pan, over low to medium heat, and add the garlic cloves, unpeeled but slightly crushed. 
            After about 1 minute, add the potato cubes and cover the pan with a lid.</li>
        <li>Fry them for about 10 minutes, making sure to turn them from one side to the other from time to time.</li>
        <li>After the potatoes have lightly browned, add the zucchini.</li>
        <li>Add salt and pepper to taste and mix carefully.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan with a lid and cook the potatoes and zucchini for about 7-8 minutes over low to moderate heat.</li>
        <li>When the zucchini is al dente (slightly crispy), remove the lid and stir the vegetables over moderate heat for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>We taste this wonderful dish with potatoes and zucchini immediately. It can also be eaten cold, it is delicious just like that. 
            Bon appetit and cool days!</li>
    </ol>
