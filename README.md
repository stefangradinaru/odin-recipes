# odin-recipes
This project has an index.html file, where we have 3 links, each with a recipe.
Also, each link leads to one of the three recipe files (also html type) created in the "recipes" folder (folder that is part of the "odin-recipes" project)
The three files are called "shawarma.html", "beefStew.html" and "potatoesAndZucchini.html"
Each file has: 
- a title with the specific recipe;
- an image with the recipe;
- a short description of the recipe;
- the necessary ingredients and weights;
- the steps needed to make the dish.
